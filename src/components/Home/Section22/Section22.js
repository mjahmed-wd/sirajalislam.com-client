        I restructured the original financing, as well as drafting the new
        Shariah compliant financing document, the documents on the original
        financing were drafted by the borrowers counsel, and accordingly the
        lenders thought that I should draft all the new addendum documents for
        the transaction going forward due to the fact that it was no longer a
        straight forward transaction but effectively a restructure of the whole
        financing.

        involved with the project that had effectively entered into significant
        difficulties to complete.
